These notebooks were written as part of my role as Head Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Duke's CS1 course. Part of my responsibilities include monitoring UTA performance in office hours/on the Ed Discussion platform and reporting back to the professor and teaching associate during weekly head staff meetings. I use these notebook to obtain basic summary information about student-UTA interactions and to flag any suspicious behavior. All of the resulting dataframes are hidden to protect the privacy of the teaching assistants, but the majority of the code is present.
